The One Ring was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.
Into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life.
Though it was lost for ages, the Ring endured — passing from one bearer to another,
corrupting minds and bending destinies.

The Ring has a will of its own.
It abandons masters, tempts the weak, and destroys the powerful.
Every bearer believes they can control it.
Every bearer is wrong.
